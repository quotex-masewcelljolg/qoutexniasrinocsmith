## What is the OTC Market?

The over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized marketplace where
financial instruments are traded directly between two parties without
the supervision of a central exchange. This means that trades are
negotiated and executed directly between buyers and sellers, rather than
through a centralized platform.

OTC markets are often used to trade assets that are not listed on
traditional exchanges, such as penny stocks, bonds, and derivatives.
They also play a significant role in the trading of foreign exchange
(forex) and commodities.
